Continuum data reduction using CASA
====================================

The tutorial is intended to provide you an introduction to the basic steps involved in 
the analysis of continuum data from the GMRT. We will be using a band-4 (550 - 750 MHz) 
dataset.

CASA version used for the tutorial: 6.5.2

Introduction
-------------

You need to have CASA installed on your machine. You also need the data to be available on your disk.

From the GMRT online archive you can download data in "lta" or "FITS" format. If you downloaded the data in lta format then you will need to do the following steps to convert it to FITS format. You can download the pre-compiled binary files "listscan" and "gvfits" from the observatory. 

LTA to FITS conversion
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: 
   
   listscan fileinltaformat.lta

At the end of this a file with extension .log is created. The next step is to run gvfits on this file.

.. code-block:: 
   
   gvfits fileinltaformat.log 

The file TEST.FITS contains your visibilities in FITS format. Before running gvfits, you can edit the fileinltaformat.log and provide a
name of your choice in place of TEST.FITS.

FITS to MS conversion
++++++++++++++++++++++

At this stage start CASA using the command ``casa`` on your terminal. You will be on the Ipython prompt and a logger window will appear. 
The remaining analysis will be done at the CASA Ipython prompt. We use the CASA task importgmrt to convert 
data from FITS to MS format. In our case the FITS file is already provided so we proceed with that FITS file.

.. code-block::

   casa
   inp importgmrt
   fitsfile='SGRB-DATA.FITS'
   vis='multi.ms'
   go importgmrt

The output file *multi.ms* file will contain your visibilities in MS format.

.. figure:: /images/continuum/importgmrtlog.png
   :alt: Importgmrt log
   :align: center
   :scale: 70% 
   
   *Output of the task importgmrt in the logger and view of the terminal. We will ignore the warnings in the logger for this tutorial.*

An alternative way to run the task is as follows:

.. code-block::

   importgmrt(fitsfile=''SGRB-DATA.FITS',vis='multi.ms')

For the tutorial, we will follow the first method.

The MS format stores the visibility data in the form of a table. The *data* column contains the data. Operations 
like calibration and deconvolution will produce additional columns such as the *corrected* and *model* data columns.

Data inspection
----------------

You will first want to know about the contents of the MS file. 
The task listobs will provide a summary of the contents of your dataset in the logger window. 

.. code-block::

   inp listobs
   vis='multi.ms'
   go listobs

.. figure:: /images/continuum/listobslog.png
   :alt: Listobs log
   :align: center
   :scale: 70% 
   
   *Output of the task listobs in the logger.*

You can also choose to save the output to a text file so that you can refer to it when needed without having to run the task.

.. code-block::

   inp listobs
   vis='multi.ms'
   listfile='listobs-out.txt' 
   go listobs

Note the scans, field ids, source names, number of channels, total bandwidth, channel width and central frequency for your observations.
Field ids (e. g. 0, 1, 2) can be used in subsequent task to choose sources instead of their names (e. g. 3C286, SGRB, etc.).

The task ``plotms`` is used to plot the data. It opens a GUI in which you can choose to display portions of your data.
Go through the help for plotms GUI in CASA documentation.

.. admonition:: Note
It is important to make a good choice of parameters to plot, so that you do not end up asking to plot too much data at the same 
time - this can either lead to crashing of plotms or may take a long time to display the data. 

Our aim is to inspect the data for non-working antennas. A good choice would be to limit the fields to 
calibrators and choosing a single channel and plot Amp Vs Time and iterating over antennas. 
Another good plot for inspection is to choose a single antenna, choose all the channels and plot Amp Vs Channel while iterating 
over baselines.

It is good to set the inputs for a task to default before running it. 

.. code-block::

   default(plotms)
   plotms

.. figure:: /images/continuum/plotmsampvstime.png
   :alt: Plotms screenshot
   :align: center
   :scale: 70% 
   
   *Screenshot of plotms. Fields 0 and 1 for the channel 400 and correlation rr are plotted for antenna C00. Iteration over anntennas in the Page tab seen on the left of the plotms window.*


Flagging
---------

Editing out bad data (e. g. non-working antennas, RFI affected channels, etc.) is termed as flagging. In our MS file, 
the bad data will be marked with flags and not actually removed as such - thus the term *flagging*.
The task ``flagdata`` will be used to flag the data. See the detailed CASA documentation on flagging using the 
task ``flagdata``.

Here some typical steps of flagging are outlined to get you started.

Usually the first spectral channel is saturated. Thus it is a good idea to flag the first spectral channel. The input 
'spw = 0:0' sets the choice of spectral window 0, channel number 0. 

.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   mode = 'manual'
   spw = '0:0'
   savepars = True
   cmdreason = 'badchan'
   go flagdata


Flagging the first and last records of all the scans is also similarly a good idea. Remember to set the task inputs to *default* 
before entering new inputs. 

.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   mode = 'quack'
   quackmode = 'beg'
   quackinterval = 10
   savepars = True
   cmdreason ='quackbeg'
   go flagdata

.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   mode = 'quack'
   quackmode = 'endb'
   quackinterval = 10
   savepars = True
   cmdreason ='quackend'
   go flagdata
   
   
In the next step we would like to flag data on antennas that were not working.
Using ``plotms``, find out which antennas were not working. Non-working antennas *generally* show up as those having very small amplitude even on bright calibrators, show no relative change of amplitude for calibrators and target sources and the phases towards calibrator sources on any given baseline will be randomly distributed between -180 to 180 degreees. If such antennas are found in the data, those can be flagged using 
the task ``flagdata``. 

.. admonition:: Note

   Only an example is provided here - you need to locate the bad antennas in the tutorial data and flag those. 

Remember also that the some antennas may not be bad at all times. However if an antennas stops working while on the target source, it can be difficult to find out. Thus make a decision based on the secondary calibrator scans. Depending on when such antennas stopped working, you can choose to flag them for that duration. Check the two polarizations separately.

Although ``plotms`` provides options for flagging data interactively, at this stage, we will choose to just locate the bad data and flag it using the task ``flagdata``.


.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   mode = 'manual'
   antenna = 'E02, S02, W06'
   savepars = True
   cmdreason = 'badant'
   inp flagdata
   go flagdata

It is a good idea to review the inputs to the task using (``inp flagdata``) before running it.

Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) are the manmade radio band signals that enter the data and are unwanted. Signals such as 
those produced by satellites, aircraft communications are confined to narrow bands in the frequency and will appear as 
frequency channels that have very high amplitudes. It is not easy to remove the RFI from such channels and recover our astronomical 
signal. Thus we will flag the affected channels (may be individual or groups of channels). There are many ways to flag RFI - could be done manually after inspecting the spectra or using automated flaggers that look for outliers.

At this stage this will be done on the time-frequency plane for each baseline using the mode *tfcrop* in the task ``flagdata``.
In the first step we get an idea about the amount of flagging that will result from our choice of parameters ``action = 'calculate`` 
is the parameter that allows us to see this. Since we are still looking at uncalibrated data, we should be flagging only the 
worst RFI - the flagging percentage of a few percent is ok but if it shows high amount of flagging, 
one would like to increase the cutoffs used and check again. You may even decide to not use this automated flagger and examine the 
data further using plotms and locate the bad data and flag using ``manual`` mode in flagdata.

.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   mode = 'tfcrop'
   spw  = ''
   ntime = 'scan'
   timecutoff =  6.0
   freqcutoff = 6.0
   extendflags = False
   action = 'calculate'
   display = 'both'
   inp flagdata
   go flagdata 

If we are satisfied, we could run the same task with ``action = 'apply'``.

.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   mode = 'tfcrop'
   spw  = ''
   ntime = 'scan'
   timecutoff =  6.0
   freqcutoff = 6.0
   extendflags = False
   action = 'apply'
   display = ''
   inp flagdata
   go flagdata


.. figure:: /images/continuum/plotmsafterantfcropflags.png
   :alt: Plotms screenshot after flagging
   :align: center
   :scale: 70% 

.. admonition:: Note

   If you happen to wrongly flag and would like to restore the older flags, use the task ``flagmanager`` with mode = 'list' to see the flagbackup versions. Locate the version to which you want to restore and run flagmanager with mode ='restore' providing the versionname. After that use the task ``flagmanager`` again with the to delete the unwanted flagbackup versions using it with mode ='delete' and giving the unwanted versionnames.


Now we extend the flags (growtime 80 means if more than 80% is flagged then fully flag, change if required) 


.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   mode = 'extend'
   growtime=80.0
   growfreq=80.0
   action='apply'
   inp flagdata
   go flagdata

 
Absolute flux density calibration
----------------------------------

In this step, flux densities are set for the standard flux calibrator in the data. The standard flux calibrators used at the GMRT are 3C286, 3C48 and 3C147. We can chose the flux density standard in this task. The default choice is Perlay-Butler 2017.

.. code-block::

   default(setjy)
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   field = '3C147'
   go setjy

.. figure:: /images/continuum/setjylog.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the log after setjy
   :align: center
   :scale: 80% 

If more than one flux calibrators are present, run it for each of the sources.

Delay and bandpass calibration
-------------------------------

First we will do delay calibration. In calibration, a reference antenna is required. Here "C00" is only taken as an example. You may use any antenna that is working for the whole duration of the observation. We will henceforth be using a central portion of the bandwidth. Depending on 
the shape of the band, you may change this selection.

.. admonition:: Note
   Using ``plotms`` you can choose to plot Amp Vs Channels iterating over baselines (choosing a single antenna will restrict the plot to baselines of that antenna - this will help keep the data volume selected for plotting reasonable) to see the response over the frequency channels and then decide the start and end points of channel selection. At the edges of the band the gain is low and thus we want to avoid those parts of the band.


.. code-block::

   default(gaincal)
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   caltable = 'multi.K1'
   field ='3C286'
   spw = '0:51~1950'
   solint = '60s'
   refant = 'C00'
   solnorm = True
   gaintype = 'K'
   inp gaincal
   go gaincal



An initial gain calibration will be done. 

.. code-block::

   default(gaincal)
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   caltable = 'multi.G0'
   field ='3C286'
   spw = '0:51~1950'
   solint = 'int'
   refant = 'C00'
   minsnr = 2.0
   gaintype = 'G'
   gaintable = ['multi.K1']
   inp gaincal
   go gaincal


Bandpass calibration using the flux calibrator. 


.. code-block::

   default(bandpass)
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   caltable = 'multi.B1'
   field ='3C286'
   spw = '0:51~1950'
   solint = 'inf'
   refant = 'C00'
   minsnr = 2.0
   solnorm = True
   gaintable = ['multi.K1','multi.G0']
   inp bandpass
   go bandpass


Examine the bandpass table using plotms. Choose the bandpass table multi.B1 in data and check the plots Amp Vs Channels and Phase Vs Channels 
iterated over antennas.

Note the shape of the band across the frequencies. 


Gain calibration
-----------------

A final gain calibration will be done in this step. The task ``gaincal`` will be run on the calibrators (flux calibrator/s, and gain calibrator/s).

.. code-block::

   default(gaincal)
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   caltable = 'multi.AP.G1'
   field ='3C286'
   spw = '0:51~1950'
   solint = '120s'
   refant = 'C00'
   minsnr = 2.0
   gaintype = 'G'
   gaintable = ['multi.K1', 'multi.B1']
   interp = ['nearest,nearestflag', 'nearest,nearestflag']\
   inp gaincal
   go gaincal

   default(gaincal)
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   caltable = 'multi.AP.G1'
   field ='1248-199'
   spw = '0:51~1950'
   solint = '120s'
   refant = 'C00'
   minsnr = 2.0
   gaintype = 'G'
   gaintable = ['multi.K1', 'multi.B1']
   interp = ['nearest,nearestflag', 'nearest,nearestflag']
   append = True
   inp gaincal
   go gaincal


The flux density of the phase calibrator will be set in the following step.

.. code-block::

   default(fluxscale)
   inp fluxscale
   vis = 'multi.ms'
   caltable = 'multi.AP.G1'
   fluxtable = 'multi.fluxscale'
   reference = '3C286'
   transfer = '1248-199'
   inp fluxscale
   go fluxscale

.. figure:: /images/continuum/fluxscalelog.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the log after fluxscale
   :align: center
   :scale: 70% 


Transfer of gain calibration to the target
-------------------------------------------

First we apply the calibration to the amplitude and phase calibrators. This task creates the *corrected* data column in the MS file.

.. code-block::

   default(applycal)
   inp applycal
   vis='multi.ms'
   field='3C286'
   spw ='0:51~1950'
   gaintable=['multi.fluxscale', 'multi.K1', 'multi.B1']
   gainfield=['3C286','','']
   interp=['nearest','','']
   calwt=[False]
   inp applycal
   go applycal


.. code-block::

   default(applycal)
   inp applycal
   vis='multi.ms'
   field='1248-199'
   spw ='0:51~1950'
   gaintable=['multi.fluxscale', 'multi.K1', 'multi.B1']
   gainfield=['1248-199','','']
   interp=['nearest','','']
   calwt=[False]
   inp applycal
   go applycal




Apply calibration to the target. 

.. code-block::

   default(applycal)
   inp applycal
   vis='multi.ms'
   field='SGRB'
   spw ='0:51~1950'
   gaintable=['multi.fluxscale', 'multi.K1', 'multi.B1']
   gainfield=['1248-199','','']
   interp=['nearest','','']
   calwt=[False]
   inp applycal
   go applycal

Use the task ``plotms`` to examine the calibrated data. You need to select *corrected* data column for plotting.

.. figure:: /images/continuum/fluxcalaftercal.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the plotms Amp Vs UVwave after calibration for the flux calibrator
   :align: center
   :scale: 80% 

   *The calibrated Amp Vs UVwave for the flux calibrator.*

.. figure:: /images/continuum/phasecalaftercal.png

   :align: center
   :scale: 80% 

   *The calibrated Amp Vs UVwave for the calibrator 1248-199.* 

You will notice that there are some baselines showing higher amplitudes than the majority or some showing a large scatter.

Use ``plotms`` to locate which antennas and baselines have the outlier data. 
Use the task ``flagdata`` to flag those data. 

Splitting the calibrated target source data
--------------------------------------------

We will split the calibrated target source data to a new file and do the subsequent analysis on that file.
Here we have chosen to drop some more of the edge channels.

.. code-block::

   default(mstransform)
   inp mstransform
   vis='multi.ms' 
   outputvis = 'SGRB-split.ms'
   field='SGRB'
   spw='0:201~1800'
   datacolumn='corrected'
   inp mstransform
   go mstransform

Flagging on calibrated data
----------------------------

In this section flagging is done on calibrated target source data.

.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis = 'SGRB-split.ms'
   mode = 'tfcrop'
   timecutoff = 5.0 
   freqcutoff = 5.0 
   timefit = 'poly'
   freqfit = 'line'
   extendflags=False
   inp flagdata
   go flagdata

 

You may try out using window statistics and vary ntime to attain better flagging. Though always be careful about not overdoing the flags.

The mode ``rflag`` needs to be used with more caution. It is better to select uvranges where you expect the amplitudes to be comparable.

.. code-block::

   default(flagdata)
   inp flagdata
   vis='SGRB-split.ms'
   mode="rflag"
   uvrange = '>3klamda'
   timedevscale=5.0
   freqdevscale=5.0
   spectralmax=500.0
   extendflags=False
   inp flagdata
   go flagdata


Examine the data using ``plotms``. Flag individual baselines as may be needed.


Averaging in frequency
-----------------------

The data are averaged in frequency to reduce the volume of the data. However the averaging is done only such that one is not affected by *bandwidth smearing*. For Band 4 it is recommended to average up to 10 channels (when BW is 200 MHz over 2048 channels). However in order to keep the computation time reasonable, for this tutorial we will average 20 channels. You can check the effect of this on the shapes of the 
sources at the edge of the field.


.. code-block::

   default(mstransform)
   inp mstransform
   vis='SGRB-split.ms'
   outputvis='SGRB-avg-split.ms'
   chanaverage=True 
   chanbin=20
   inp mstransform
   go mstransform

Some more flagging will be done on the data at this stage to get the final dataset for imaging.
Use ``plotms`` to decide on where and what you would like to flag and proceed accordingly.


Imaging
--------

We will use the task ``tclean`` for imaging. Go through the CASA documentation for tclean to understand the meaning of the various parameters. 
To save on computation, in this example we have set wprojplanes=128. In general to account for the w-term more accurately set wprojplanes= -1 so that it will be calculated internally in CASA. In this example we have used *interactive = False* in tclean. 

.. admonition:: Things to try
   To go step by step you can choose to do tclean keeping niter=0. This will make an image where no deconvolution would have been done - i. e. it will be a 'dirty image'. When doing tclean with non-zero niter, you may choose to do an *interactive = True*, put the boxes on the sources you want to deconvolve manually to learn the process. Read the CASA documentation to do an interactive tclean. This can enable you to control the mask.


.. code-block::

   default(tclean)
   inp tclean
   vis='SGRB-avg-split.ms'
   imagename='SGRB-img'
   imsize=7200
   cell='1.0arcsec'
   specmode='mfs'
   gridder='wproject'
   wprojplanes=128 
   pblimit=-0.0001
   deconvolver='mtmfs'
   nterms=2 
   weighting='briggs'
   robust=0
   niter=2000
   threshold='0.01mJy'
   cyclefactor = 0.5 
   interactive=False
   usemask='auto-multithresh'
   sidelobethreshold=2.0
   pbmask=0.0
   savemodel='modelcolumn'
   inp tclean
   go tclean

Keep an eye on the logger messages to get an idea about the processing and in particular see the total flux cleaned.
Once the task ends successfully, you can view the image using ``imview``. 
The main image you would like to see is the one with the extension *image.tt0*. 
Adjust the data range to display it in a reasonable colour scale to show the peaks as well as the noise in the image.
Also inspect the rest of the images created by tclean - the .psf, .mask, .model, .residual. 

.. code-block::

   imview

   :align: center
   :scale: 70% 

   *A zoom-in on the central region of the first image.*


Self-calibration
-----------------

This is an iterative process. The model from the first tclean is used to calibrate the data and the corrected data are then imaged to make a better model and the process is repeated. The order of the tasks is tclean, gaincal, applycal, tclean. A reasonable choice is to do 5 phase only and two amplitude and phase self-calibrations. We start from a longer "solint" (solution interval), for e. g. "8min" and gradually lower it to "1min" during the phase only iterations. For "a&p" self-calibration, again choose a longer solint such as "2min". We keep solnorm=False in phase only iterations and solnorm=True in "a&p" self-calibration. As the iterations advance, the model sky is expected to get better so in the task tclean, lower the threshold and increase niter.

.. code-block::

   default(gaincal)
   vis ='GRB-avg-split.ms'
   caltable='selcal-p1.GT'
   solint = '8min'
   refant ='C00'
   minsnr = 3.0
   gaintype = 'G' 
   solnorm= False
   calmode ='p'
   go gaincal
   
  Using the task "plotcal" you can examine the gain table. In successive iterations of self-calibration, you should find that the phases are more and more tightly scattered around zero. If this trend is not there, you can suspect that the self-calibration is not going well - check the previous tclean runs to see if the total cleaned flux was increasing.

.. code-block::

   default(applycal)
   vis='SGRB-avg-split.ms'
   gaintable='selcal-p1.GT'
   applymode='calflag'
   interp=['linear']
   go applycal

We will split the corrected data to a new file and use it for imaging. This is just for better book-keeping. You may choose to do the successive self-calibration iterations on the same MS file but remember that the corrected data and model data columns will be overwritten by applycal and tclean.

.. code-block::

   default(mstransform)
   vis='SGRB-avg-split.ms'
   datacolumn='corrected' 
   outputvis='vis-selfcal-p1.ms'
   go mstransform
   

In the next iteration we will use a larger niter and lower the threshold. In the tclean messages do check the total cleaned flux and the number of iterations needed to reach that.

.. code-block::

   default(tclean)
   imagename='SGRB-img1'
   imsize=7200
   cell='1.0arcsec'
   specmode='mfs'
   gridder='wproject'
   wprojplanes=128 
   pblimit=-0.0001
   deconvolver='mtmfs'
   nterms=2 
   weighting='briggs'
   robust=0
   niter=4000
   threshold='0.01mJy'
   cyclefactor = 0.5 
   interactive=False
   usemask='auto-multithresh'
   sidelobethreshold=2.0
   pbmask=0.0
   savemodel='modelcolumn'
   inp tclean
   go tclean
   

Repeat until you stop seeing improvement in the image sensitivity.

After you get your final image you need to do a primary beam correction. The task "widebandpbcor" in CASA does not have the information of the GMRT primary beam shape. A modified version of this task called `ugmrtpb`_ has been written for the uGMRT primary beam correction. You can follow the instructions there to do a primary beam correction for your image.

For this tutorial on the RAS machines please see the steps `here`_. This step can not be performed in newer versions of the CASA as custom tasks can not be made by the users. So, either access a precompiled version of the task, which is always going to be messy. Better to use a new software, which has the sole purpose of correcting primary beams for uGMRT images. Finalflash (`finalflash`_) is developed by astronomers at NCRA and has the latest beam co-efficients are available.

I assume you are on a python3 environment, do, pip3 install finalflash 

Done, now just have to run finalflash <input_fits_image> <output_fits_image>

In case, you do not have a fits image, do exportfits("your_image_name", fitsimage='fits_image.fits') inside the CASA console.
